{- $Helpers
Using the `Drawable` API directly does not make much sense with t`CodeWorld.Test.NormalizedPicture`s,
since concrete parameters are abstracted.
The following functions can be used instead to build an image more generally.
-}

{- $NormalizedQueries
Functions for retrieving parameters of a t`CodeWorld.Test.NormalizedPicture`.
For each parameter there is an abstract and a concrete version.
The concrete version simply removes the abstract type wrapper and returns the contained value.

These are meant to be used on non-composite values only (no `&` or `pictures`),
meaning only one value is returned.
Use the functions in [Queries on Components](#queries) if retrieval of all parameters of a specific kind is desired.
-}

{- $AbsTypes
Abstract versions of data types used as parameters in CodeWorld's `Picture` type.
Retain the concrete value, unless stated otherwise, so it can be extracted if necessary.
-}

{- $SpatialView
Aside from normalizing the picture and retrieving (individual) parameters,
we also want to inspect how components are laid out on the canvas
and query their parameters as a whole.
The following data types and functions implement this more /zoomed out/ approach.
-}

{- $PointLists
Point list based shapes like `curve`, `polyline` or `polygon` differ from other basic shapes
in that they can be drawn anywhere instead of only in a fixed position in the origin.
Conventional detection of translation, rotation or scaling is thus not possible.
These functions help remedy this problem by comparing two point lists
to see if a transformation was applied to one to get the other.
-}

{- $StrictPictures
Exposed internals of the student facing `Picture` type.
This is useful if specific attributes can be determined directly from the un-normalized syntax tree.
Primitives from [Uniplate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/uniplate-1.6.13) can then be employed
to generically traverse the structure.
-}

{- |
Convert a `Picture` into a t`CodeWorld.Test.NormalizedPicture`.
This applies a number of simplifications, abstractions and rearrangements on the syntax tree of the image.
The result is a new tree in /canonical/ form.
-}
normalize :: Picture -> NormalizedPicture
normalize = toInterface

{- |
Apply `normalize`, then re-concretize the abstracted syntax tree.
The result is a new syntax tree, which draws the same image,
but was simplified and rearranged via `normalize`'s rules.
-}
reduce :: Picture -> Picture
reduce = toConcretePicture . toInterface

{- |
Same as `reduce`,
but also erases information on which subpictures are drawn in front or behind others.
-}
reduceNoOrder :: Picture -> Picture
reduceNoOrder p = case reduce p of
  PRec (Pictures ps) -> PRec $ Pictures $ sort ps
  rp                 -> rp
